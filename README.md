# CredVaultAPI

CredVault is a credential management API that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage their login credentials for websites they access using a RESTful service.

This is an ASP.NET Core Web API project that demonstrates key backend development concepts such as **Dependency Injection**, **DTO‚ÄìDomain Model Mapping**, **Entity Framework Core Migrations**, **Asynchronous Programming**, and the **Repository Pattern** ‚Äî with SQL Server as the database.

## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

### 1. Initial Commit: Domain Model
- Created base Web API project using Visual Studio.
- Added `User` and `Credential` domain model classes.

### 2. Database Connection & Migration
- Added SQL Server connection string in `appsettings.json`.
- Registered `CredVaultDbContext` in `Program.cs` using Dependency Injection.
- Ran `Add-Migration` and `Update-Database` to create database schema.

### 3. DTO & Controller Implementation
- Created `UserDto`.
- Implemented HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in `UserController`.
- Mapped Domain Model ‚Üî DTO manually inside controller.

### 4. Asynchronous Programming and Repository Pattern
- Converted all controller actions to `async Task<IActionResult>`.
- Used `await` with EF Core operations to support non-blocking I/O, improving performance, reponsiveness, and scalability.
- Introduced `IUserRepository` interface and `UserRepository` implementation to abstract data access logic.
- All database interactions were moved from the controller to the repository.
- The controller now uses constructor injection to depend on `IUserRepository`.
- This pattern enforces separation of concerns: the controller is responsible for handling HTTP requests, while the repository handles data operations using `CredVaultDbContext`.
